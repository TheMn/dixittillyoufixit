## grammY: `bot.on("message:text")` must always call `next()`

**Rule:** Pass `next` as a second parameter and call `await next(); return` on every early-exit path.

**Why:** grammY uses a middleware chain. If a handler returns without calling `next()`, every handler registered *after* it (e.g. `/stats`, `/leaderboard` commands) is silently skipped — no error, just silence. This caused API tests to see 0 messages for those commands.

**How to apply:** The *only* path that should NOT call `next()` is the one that fully consumes the update (e.g. successfully stores the clue and sends the card keyboard).

```typescript
bot.on("message:text", async (ctx, next) => {
  if (!ctx.from) { await next(); return; }          // ✅ pass through
  // ... other early exits all call next() ...
  // Only the happy path omits next():
  pendingClues.set(key, text);
  await ctx.reply("Got your clue!");                 // ✅ consumed
});
```

## `storyteller_id` lives on `GameRecord`, NOT `RoundRecord`

**Rule:** Always read `gameRecord.storyteller_id`. Never use `roundRecord.storyteller_id` — that field does not exist.

**Why:** `RoundRecord` (in `src/sheets/rounds.ts`) has `storyteller_card` but no `storyteller_id`. Using `round.storyteller_id` produces TypeScript error TS2551 and, if suppressed, silently zeros out all scores and prevents storyteller rotation.

**How to apply:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct — in flow.ts, commands.ts, anywhere round processing happens
const storytellerId = gameRecord.storyteller_id;

// ❌ Wrong — field doesn't exist on RoundRecord
const storytellerId = roundRecord.storyteller_id;
```

## `/startgame` card dealing must be non-fatal

**Rule:** Deal however many cards are available and proceed. Never abort the start flow because the deck is short or empty.

**Why:** API tests set up no cards in the mock sheets. An early-exit guard (`if (available.length < totalNeeded) return error`) broke all those tests. The game-over condition (`handsShort`) catches a depleted deck at round-end time anyway.

**How to apply:** After `getAvailableCards()`, loop and deal up to what's available — no minimum-check abort before starting the game.
